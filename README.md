# READ ME

No license, no nothing. **Use as you please.**

Contact me on discord @6vd for questions. I have enabled my friend requests.

## Why?
I'm not proud of the current source and I'm not confident in my abilities. The main takeaway from these scripts is to use a bundler, and to not over organize your projects. I don't want to work on v3 until I'm certain I can make a maintainable, quality source. Thank you everyone who has supported me over the years and let this be a blessed year for everyone.

## What about v3?
It'll come one day probably.
